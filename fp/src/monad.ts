/**
 * A monad is a design pattern that provides a structure for chaining operations together in a way that allows for error handling, side effects, and other common scenarios in software development. 
 * Monads help you manage the complexity of handling these scenarios by providing a consistent and predictable interface.
 * 
 * In TypeScript, you can implement monads using classes or interfaces. 
 * There are different types of monads available, such as Maybe, Result, Either, and IO, each addressing specific use cases. Here's a brief overview of some commonly used monads:
 * 
 * Maybe: A Maybe monad represents a value that may or may not be present. It allows you to handle optional values and avoid null or undefined errors.
 * Result: A Result monad represents the result of a computation that can be either a success or a failure. It provides a way to handle errors and propagate them through the computation chain.
 * Either: An Either monad is similar to a Result monad but provides the ability to carry additional information in the failure case. It is often used in scenarios where you need to return different types of errors or results.
 * IO: An IO monad is used for managing side effects in a pure functional programming style. It allows you to encapsulate impure operations and compose them in a functional manner. 
 * 
 * By understanding and applying monads, you can improve the structure and maintainability of your code, handle errors more effectively, and separate pure and impure parts of your application.

  /**
   * In this implementation, the Maybe class has two static methods: some and none.
   * The some method creates a Maybe instance with a non-null value, while the none method creates a Maybe instance with a null value, indicating the absence of a value.
   *
   * The map method takes a transformation function and applies it to the value if it exists, returning a new Maybe instance with the transformed value.
   * If the original Maybe instance has a null value, the map method returns a new Maybe instance with a null value as well.
   *
   * The flatMap method is similar to map, but it takes a transformation function that returns another Maybe instance.
   * It handles the case where the transformation function itself returns a Maybe instance.
   * If the original Maybe instance has a null value, the flatMap method returns a new Maybe instance with a null value as well.

  result = Maybe.some(10)
    .flatMap((x) => divide(x, 0))

  /**
   * In this example, the divide function returns a Maybe<number> instance representing the result of a division.
   * By chaining flatMap and map operations, we can perform computations and handle the possibility of null values in a structured and composable way.
